Monotheism is the belief that there is only one God. This is a core doctrine of Christianity and, before that, Judaism. Repeatedly throughout the Torah and the Bible as a whole, it is stated that there is only one God: <span lang="he">יהוה</span> (Yahweh). He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things. Without Him, there is nothing.

> Deuteronomy 6:4  Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

> Deuteronomy 4:35  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside him.

> Deuteronomy 4:39  Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

> Isaiah 43:10–11  Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no savior.

> Isaiah 44:6  Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

> John 1:1–3  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

> Ephesians 4:4–5  There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism.

> 1 Timothy 2:5  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

That's not to say there are no other supernatural forces. The Bible talks of how some of the angels whom God created have rebelled against him and now [seek to lead men astray]({% link _doctrines/deceiving-spirits.md %}). They may pretend to be gods, but they are not.

> 1 Corinthians 10:20  But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.

Nor is that to say that God exists as a simple, single person. Incomprehensibly, God exists as a Trinity of three equal, eternal, cosubstantial, distinct persons sharing one nature. This is a mystery that we cannot fully understand, but these three persons are nonetheless one God.
