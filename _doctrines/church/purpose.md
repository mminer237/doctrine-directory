title: Purpose of the Church
description: Christ's church has many purposes in this life and the next, but the primary purpose of our lives here on earth should be to share the good news of Christ with others.

The primary purpose of the church is evangelism. While some denominations call themselves "Evangelicals", really [all major Christian denominations agree that the number one goal of the church should be to lead as many people to Christ as possible.](https://denominationdifferences.com/common-ground/purpose-of-the-church)

God did not put us on this earth to live for ourselves. As God is love and loved us, so too we are to love others. John 15:12 We are to put others needs before our own. Philippians 2:4 That's what true love isâ€”putting others first. Love provides for others' needs.

Men's greatest need is a right relationship with their creator. Sharing the free gift of salvation and adoption into the family of God is one of the greatest acts of love one can do. As we have received, so are we to give. Matthew 10:8b

God doesn't *need* a church. God could call us home the moment we become His, but He doesn't. He has left us on this earth for the privilege of serving Him. We are ambassadors for Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:20 Ambassadors are to represent someone to others and promote them. We are not to live for our own needs but live to promote the cause of Christ.
