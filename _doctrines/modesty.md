Modesty is a virtue that is rather divisive in many ways in today's society. Generally it is today understood as meaning wearing clothes that adequately cover the body, primarily to avoid sexually arousing others. Biblically, this is certainly laudable—we should try to avoid stirring up lust. However, modesty is a much broader concept than just that, and the modern take on modesty is only barely mentioned in the Bible.

The Bible only discusses modesty directly once, in 1 Timothy 2:9-10:

> 1 Timothy 2:9–10  In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

It is discussing dress but not strictly in a sense of showing too much skin. Rather, the alternative to modesty is said to be wearing gold and fancy clothes. Being immodest is not described as being sexy but as looking fancy and well-to-do. Paul is writing against trying to draw attention to yourself and to make yourself look better and more important than others. In many cases, modern immodesty also has a component of trying to draw attention to oneself and certainly everyone wants to look good, but the root sin Paul is preaching against is pride, not lust.

Biblical modesty is similar to humility. It is not puffing yourself up, not living a lavish lifestyle. It is unassuming. Think having a modest home, not a modest swimsuit. It is understanding that everything we have is a gift from God and that we don't deserve any of it. We should love others, not flaunt our wealth over them. God wants us to enjoy life and the good things He has given us, but not to live a hedonistic lifestyle. Our hope and worth is in Christ, not in our possessions or appearance.

There much to be said about dressing in a non-revealing way as well however. Even though the Bible does not talk much about such, it is certainly a part of modesty. Not only does dressing modestly help counteract pride, but it also helps to avoid stirring up lust in others. Even though the Bible does not mandate a specific dress code, it gives principles that we can use to set our own standards. Our goal in dress, like in everything else, should be to glorify God. 1 Corinthians 10:31–32. We have liberty to dress how we choose, but love considers how your actions affect others and is willing to give up our rights for others' growth. Certainly, the ultimate guilt for lust lies with the one lusting. Unlike, say, Islam which [mandates women to cover up their bodies to prevent men from lusting after them](https://quran.com/en/an-nur/31), Jesus said the logical extreme solution for lust would be to gouge out your own eyes rather than anything about making others cover up. Matthew 5:28–29. However, we should still try to avoid causing others to sin. Romans 14:13–15. If you know that wearing something will provoke others to lust, you should generally avoid wearing it.

> Galatians 5:13  For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

There are no hard and fast rules about what dress is acceptable and what is not, but our choices about what to wear should always be guided by a love for God and others. When considering what to wear, it is important to ask yourself what your motivations are. Are you trying to draw attention to yourself? Are you trying to look better than others? Are you trying to turn people on? The Bible says we should avoid doing these things. Even if we are not intentionally trying to do these things, we should still consider how our actions affect others.
