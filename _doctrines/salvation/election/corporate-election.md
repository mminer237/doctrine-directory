Corporate election is the belief that God chooses to save the church as a whole rather than choosing individuals to save.

> Ephesians 1:4â€“5  According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will

> 1 Thessalonians 1:4  Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
