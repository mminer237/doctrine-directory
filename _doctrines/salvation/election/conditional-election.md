Conditional election is the doctrine that God elects, or chooses, whom to save based on who chooses to place his faith in Christ and accept His gift. As God is omniscient and outside of time, He has always seen all who will choose Him in our future.

> Romans 8:29  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

This view emphasizes man's free will. God gives us grace to overcome our [depravity]({% link _doctrines/human-nature/total-depravity.md %}), but then leaves the choice to accept Him or reject Him up to us. Those who believe are saved, and those who don't, aren't.

> John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

The opposing view is [unconditional election]({% link _doctrines/salvation/election/unconditional-election.md %}). This instead says that God chooses people independent of any known trait or action (as people are incapable of choosing God without His grace) and usually that no one whom He gives that grace to can reject Him.
