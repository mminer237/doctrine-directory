<span lang="la">Sola fide</span>, Latin for "faith alone", is the doctrine that salvation is by grace through faith alone. There's nothing else we have to do to be saved. We don't have to do any works to earn our salvation, and indeed there's nothing we *could* do to make us more worthy of salvation. Salvation is gift only received by God's grace. All we have to do is repent and have faith in Christ to receive it.
