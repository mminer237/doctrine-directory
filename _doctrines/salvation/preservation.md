There are two main views on the preservation of one's salvation:

1. [Eternal Security]({% link _doctrines/salvation/preservation/eternal-security.md %}){: .big}
2. <span>Conditional Preservation</span>{: .big}

However, within Conditional Preservation, there are many variations as to how and when one can lose his salvation.

Both sides agree that there is nothing external to the believer that can cause him to lose his salvation. However, they disagree on whether or not the believer can lose his salvation by his own actions.
