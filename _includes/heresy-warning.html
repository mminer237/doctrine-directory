	<p>The doctrine explained on this page is generally considered heretical by Christians. Its inclusion as a doctrine is not an endorsement of its truthfulness. There are many false doctrines. 2 Peter 2:1–3</p>
	<p>This page not only explains the doctrine, but hopefully why it is widely known to be false. It is good to be aware and ready to give an answer to false doctrines. 2 Timothy 4:2–5</p>
